- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, for a modern, machined, objective look, is used for readability and a clean user interface.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif, complements the body font for a modern, techy feel that works well for headlines.
- Use a consistent set of professional, modern icons throughout the site to represent different skills, categories, and actions.
